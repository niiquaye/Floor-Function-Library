# Floor-Function-Library
This library was created as a user defined version of the floor funtion in the <math.h> header.
The floor function takes in a double as an argument and rounds the double to the next lowest integer.

The floor-function library uses no additional libraries. Everything inside the implementation file and 
header file are user defined. The use of static functions allows the one using the code to easily acces 
the floor-function library capabilities.

To use this library simply download the source and header file. Then Inlude it in your current project directory.
Once it has been included, simply type the following command ' floor::function(enter a double) '.
